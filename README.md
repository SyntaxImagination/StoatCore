# STOATCORE
The StoatCore is like the Engine that will run Stoat and it will always remain updateable.
The idea behind this is to ensure we can 
    - Globalize Stoat
    - Ensure we can update some main features of Stoat without breaking the application itself
    - Ensure better flowing legacy support

## FEATURES PLAN
    -[] CLI
    -[x] Updatable Logic
